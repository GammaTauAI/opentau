# Using OpenAI Codex for Gradual Type Inference

- Current implementation is focussed on TypeScript
  - Python implementation comes next

## Requirements

- `rust`
- For type-inferring typescript:
  - `ts-node`
  - `tsc`

## Installation
Run `make` while being in the directory

The output binary (symlinked) will be at `/out/client`
