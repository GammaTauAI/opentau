### Potential Projects

Our group is thinking about implementing type inference and migration utilizing a general purpose language model such as OpenAI Codex. This implementation will be capable of type-annotating gradually-typed languages such as TypeScript and Python (using the Pyright type-checker). The implementation will aim to be generalizable in order to ease the implementation of  additional languages.

#### Group Members

The members of this group are:

- Federico Cassano
- Noah Shinn
